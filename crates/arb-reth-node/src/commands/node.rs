//! `arb-reth node`: runnable entrypoint for the Arbitrum engine-tree node.
//!
//! This wires the CLI to the [`ArbLauncher`] custom `LaunchNode`: it opens an on-disk MDBX
//! database under the data directory, boots reth's `LaunchContext` provider/blockchain-db
//! stack, spawns the `ArbEngineDriver` block producer (which drives reth's engine tree; see
//! `launcher.rs`), and optionally serves the `eth_*` JSON-RPC API.
//!
//! ## Feed sources
//!
//! The sequencer-feed channel is created but left empty by default. L1-inbox derivation
//! (`--l1-rpc`, below) or `--replay-feed` fills it.
//!
//! With `--replay-feed <NDJSON>` the binary reads a file of
//! `BroadcastFeedMessage` JSON objects (one per line) and pushes them all into the
//! feed channel immediately after launch, then keeps the feed channel open so the
//! driver can drain it while RPC queries remain servable. The held sender keeps the
//! node alive until SIGTERM. This lets a user run a finite replay and then inspect
//! the produced blocks via JSON-RPC.
//!
//! With `--arb-chain-config <PATH>` an Arbitrum chain-config JSON is parsed to produce a real
//! ArbOS genesis allocation instead of the MAINNET placeholder.
